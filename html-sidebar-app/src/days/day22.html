<h2>第22天 定语从句</h2>
<h3>22-1 定语从句的概念</h3>
<p>
在句中起定语作用，修饰某一名词或代词，或修饰整个主句的从句，叫做定语从句 (the attributive clause)。被定语从句修饰的词叫先行词 (antecedent)。定语从句通常跟在先行词之后，由“关系词 (relatives)”引出，因此定语从句又可称为关系分句。<br>
关系词可分为：<br>
<strong>关系代词：</strong> which, that, who, whom, whose 等。<br>
<strong>关系副词：</strong> when, where, why 等。<br>
关系词常有3个作用：1）引导定语从句；2）代替先行词；3）在定语从句中担当一个成分（如主语、宾语、定语和状语等）。<br>
例：The girl who is singing in the classroom is my sister.<br>
（the girl是先行词，who引导定语从句并在从句中作主语）<br>
This is the room where Lu Xun once lived.<br>
（the room是先行词，where引导定语从句并作地点状语）
</p>

<h3>22-2 关系代词引导的定语从句</h3>
<p>
关系代词所代替的先行词是表示人或物的名词或代词，并在从句中充当主语、宾语、定语等成分。关系代词在定语从句中作主语时，从句谓语动词的人称和数要和先行词保持一致。
<ul>
  <li><strong>who, whom, that</strong>：代替人的名词或代词。who作主语，whom作宾语，that可作主语或宾语（作宾语可省略），可指人也可指物。<br>
    The boys who are playing football are from Class One.<br>
    She is the girl whom/that I saw yesterday.<br>
    The number of the people that/who came to China each year rises one million.
  </li>
  <li><strong>whose</strong>：指人或物，指物时可与of which互换，指人时也可用of whom。<br>
    I have a classmate whose (of whom) father is a doctor.<br>
    Please give me the pencil whose (of which) color is green.
  </li>
  <li><strong>which, that</strong>：代替事物的名词或代词，在从句中可作主语、宾语等，作宾语时可省略。<br>
    Computer game is something which is liked by most boys.<br>
    Where is the book that I read this morning?
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>22-3 关系副词引导的定语从句</h3>
<p>
常见的关系副词有：why = for which，where = in/at/on/... which，when = during/on/in/... which。
<ul>
  <li><strong>when</strong> 指时间，在定语从句中作时间状语。<br>
    The time when we got together finally came.
  </li>
  <li><strong>where</strong> 指地点，在定语从句中作地点状语。<br>
    Beijing is the city where I was born.
  </li>
  <li><strong>why</strong> 指原因，在定语从句中作原因状语。<br>
    Please tell me the reason why you are late.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>22-4 介词+关系代词引导的定语从句</h3>
<p>
关系代词在定语从句中作介词宾语时，从句常由“介词 + 关系代词”引导。<br>
This is the school in which I studied two years ago.<br>
We'll go to hear the famous singer about whom we have often talked.
</p>

<h3>22-5 限定性定语从句和非限定性定语从句</h3>
