<h3>7-3 虚拟语气的用法</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>虚拟语气在条件从句和结果主句中的用法</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>（1）表示与现在事实相反的条件或结果。条件从句谓语用动词的过去式（be的过去式用were），主句谓语用should/would + 动词原形。例如：<br>
        If l were you, l should not do such a thing. 如果我是你的话，我就不会做这样的事。<br>
        If they had time, they would study Italian too. 假如他们有时间的话，他们也会学意大利语的。
      </li>
      <li>（2）表示与过去事实相反的条件和结果。条件从句谓语用had + 过去分词，主句谓语用should/would + have + 过去分词。例如：<br>
        He would have a chance to survive, if he had been taken to hospital in time. 如果他被及时送到医院，他就有机会活下来。
      </li>
      <li>（3）表示与将来事实可能相反的条件和结果。条件从句谓语用动词的过去式（be的过去式用were），主句用should/would + 动词原形。例如：<br>
