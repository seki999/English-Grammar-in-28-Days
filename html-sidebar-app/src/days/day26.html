  <h2>第26天 倒装句</h2>
  <h3>26-1 倒装句的概念和分类</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>1. 倒装句 (inversion) 的概念</strong><br>
    英语的最基本结构是主、谓结构，倒装就是将这种比较固定的结构加以颠倒。倒装是一种语法手段，用以表示一定句子结构的需要和强调某一句子成分的需要。<br>
    主语和谓语是句子的核心，它们之间有两种语序：一是主语在谓语之前称为自然语序（natural order），也叫正常语序，如陈述句；二是主语在谓语之后，或使用与正常词序相反的词序，这种语序则称为倒装语序（inverted order）。使用倒装语序通常是为了表达的需要或语法结构的需要，有时也为了强调。
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2. 倒装句的分类</strong><br>
    倒装语序有两种：<br>
    <strong>部分倒装（partial inversion）</strong>：将谓语的一部分（如助动词或情态动词）放至主语之前。若谓语没有助动词或情态动词，则需添加do, does, did，并将其置于主语之前。<br>
    需要部分倒装的情况有：<br>
    1) 句首为否定或半否定的词语，如no, not, never, seldom, little, hardly, at no time, in no way, not until...<br>
    例：Never have I watched such a moving film.<br>
    2) not until引导主从复合句时，主句倒装，从句不倒装。<br>
    例：Not until it stopped raining did we set out.<br>
    <strong>完全倒装（full inversion）</strong>：将句子中的谓语动词全部置于主语之前。此结构通常只用于一般现在时和一般过去时。<br>
    1) here, there, now, then, thus等副词置于句首，谓语动词常用be, come, go, lie, run等。<br>
    例：There came the bus. Here is your pen.<br>
    2) 表示运动方向的副词或地点状语置于句首，谓语是表示运动的动词。<br>
    例：Out rushed a missile from under the bomber. Ahead stands a tree.
