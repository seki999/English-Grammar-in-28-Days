<h2>第24天 插入语、直接引语和间接引语</h2>

<h3>24-1 插入语</h3>
<p>
<strong>1. 概念</strong><br>
插入语是插在句子中的一个词、短语或从句，用来补充含义或作解释。插入语通常被逗号、破折号或句子的其他部分隔开，在句中与其他部分没有语法上的联系，删掉后句子结构仍完整。
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. 插入语的类型</strong><br>
插入语可表示说话人的看法、态度、推测、解释、说明、总结、强调、引起注意、转移话题等。常见类型有：
<ul>
  <li><strong>形容词或形容词短语：</strong>True, wonderful, worse still, sure enough, strange, most important of all, strange to say 等。<br>
    例：True, it would be too bad. Wonderful, we have won again. Strange, there is nobody in the classroom.
  </li>
  <li><strong>副词或副词短语：</strong>indeed, surely, however, frankly, obviously, naturally, fortunately, briefly, honestly, besides, exactly, still, otherwise, luckily 等。<br>
    例：Honestly, I don't need it at the moment. You'll be able to pass the coming exam, surely. Unfortunately, neither of them could swim.
  </li>
  <li><strong>介词短语：</strong>in a way, for example, of course, as a matter of fact, by the way, on the contrary, on the other hand, in my opinion, in general, in a sense, in short, in conclusion 等。<br>
    例：In a way, I think we both won in the game. In my opinion, he is an honest boy. In short, we should not stop halfway.
  </li>
  <li><strong>现在分词短语：</strong>generally speaking, judging from/by..., talking of..., strictly speaking, considering, putting it mildly 等。<br>
    例：Judging from his face, he must be ill. Generally speaking, dogs can run faster than pigs.
  </li>
  <li><strong>过去分词短语：</strong>Painted white, we like the house better.</li>
  <li><strong>动词不定式：</strong>to be sure, to be frank, to tell you the truth, so to speak, to begin with 等。<br>
    例：To be frank, I don't quite agree with you. To tell you the truth, I am not very interested in going to the show.
  </li>
  <li><strong>代词词组：</strong>all the same, all told, all in all 等。<br>
    例：All in all, they have had a wonderful time today.
  </li>
  <li><strong>从句：</strong>if so, if not, if any, if I may say so, as you know, as you say, if you like, if you please, if necessary, as it happens 等。<br>
    例：If I may say so, we know nothing about it. This man, as you know, is good for nothing.
  </li>
  <li><strong>简短句子：</strong>I am sure, do you know, you see, I'm afraid, it is said, I suppose/think/believe/hope, what's more, what's worse, that is to say, what is important 等。<br>
    例：I believe, China will catch up with the developed countries sooner or later. The old man, it is said, was an artist.
  </li>
  <li><strong>标点符号引导：</strong>He was (strange as it seems) an excellent sportsman. He was to me at least, if not to you——a figure that was worth having pity on.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. 插入语特殊用法</strong><br>
插入语独立性强，一般用标点符号隔开。疑问句中插入成分（如do you think, do you suppose等）常见于口语，疑问句应保持陈述语序。<br>
例：<br>
What do you think I should do first?<br>
Who do you think is singing?<br>
How long did you say she would stay here?<br>
When do you suppose they'll be back?<br>
How old did you think she was?
</p>

<h3>24-2 直接引语和间接引语</h3>
<p>
<strong>1. 直接引语和间接引语之间的转换</strong>

      </li>
