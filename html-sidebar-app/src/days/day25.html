  <h2>第25天 主谓一致</h2>
  <h3>25-1 主谓一致的原则</h3>
  <p>
    “一致”是指句子成分之间或者词语之间在语法形式上的协调关系。主谓一致指主语和谓语动词之间在“人称”和“数”的方面的一致关系。<br>
    主谓一致的问题看似简单，实际使用时却很复杂，因为不同情况下处理这一问题所依据的原则各不相同。现代语法中，主谓一致通常有三种基本原则：<br>
    <strong>1. 语法一致（grammatical concord）</strong><br>
    主语和谓语从语法形式上取得一致，主语是单数形式，谓语也用单数；主语是复数形式，谓语用复数。<br>
    例：We have our own merits. Each of us has merits.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>不定式、动名词、从句作主语时看作单数，谓语用单数。<br>
        Reading books is a very good way to study.<br>
        To do this kind of thing requires courage.<br>
        What you have done has been seen.
      </li>
      <li>不定代词one, every, each, everybody, everyone, one of, no one, nothing, nobody, someone, somebody, either, neither, many a等作主语或修饰主语时看作单数，谓语用单数。<br>
        Neither of them is guilty.<br>
        Many a student is doing exercise.
      </li>
      <li>专有名词作主语时看作单数，谓语用单数。<br>
        Gone With the Wind is a book known to lovers of English.
      </li>
      <li>a portion, a series of, a kind of, the number of等作主语时看作单数，谓语用单数。<br>
        A kind of flower in the garden smells very pleasant.<br>
        A series of expensive goods has been sold out in the shop.
      </li>
      <li>some, several, both, few, many, a number of等修饰主语或自身作主语时看作复数，谓语用复数。and连接两个主语时，谓语一般用复数。<br>
        Both of us are basketball players.<br>
        A number of people have applied for the job.
      </li>
      <li>a lot of, most of, any of, half of, three fifths of, eighty percent of, some of, none of, the rest of, all of等后接不可数名词或单数名词作主语时用单数，接可数名词复数时用复数。<br>
        A lot of books have been published recently.<br>
        A lot of money in the shop was stolen last night.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2. 意义一致（notional concord）</strong><br>
    主语形式为单数但意义为复数时，谓语用复数；主语形式为复数但意义为单数时，谓语用单数。
    <ul>
      <li>主语后接as well as, as much as, accompanied by, including, in addition to, more than, no less than, rather than, together with等词组时，谓语形式依主语单复数而定。<br>
        Food, along with vegetable, has recently risen in price.<br>
        The teacher, with all his students, is going to have a picnic this weekend.
      </li>
      <li>表示时间、金钱、距离、体积、重量、面积、数字等词作主语，若指总量用单数，若指数量用复数。<br>
        Seven days are often regarded as one week.<br>
        Ten years stands for a long period in my life.
      </li>
      <li>the + 形容词作主语，指个人或抽象概念用单数，指一类人用复数。<br>
        The unknown is always something to be feared.<br>
        The accused was/were acquitted of the charge.<br>
        In our society, the good are rewarded.
      </li>
      <li>and连接两个主语指同一人、物、事、概念时用单数，指不同事物时用复数。<br>
        Love and right is a constant theme in history.<br>
        This shirt and that shirt are of good quality.
      </li>
      <li>集体名词作主语，表示整体时用单数，表示成员时用复数。cattle, people, police一般看作复数。<br>
        The class are all fond of basketball.<br>
        The family is quite successful.<br>
        The public has right to vote for the president.<br>
        The public now come to know that they were cheated by the government.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>3. 就近原则（principle of proximity）</strong><br>
    谓语动词的人称和数常与距离最近的主语保持一致。
